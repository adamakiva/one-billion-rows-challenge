## Implementation for the one billion rows challenge (with slight modifications)

## Rules

- No external dependencies (may have development ones for eslint and formatting).
- Each line is built in the following format: `<city>;<temperature>`.
- Amount of unique cities is limited to **10,000**
- Every city **must** start with a capital letter.
- Every city contains **only** UTF-8 characters.
- Temperature has **exactly one** fractional digit.
- Each line is separated by `\n`.
